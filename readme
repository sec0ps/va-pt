The set of scripts included in this package will create a lightweight technical testing environment for the performing of Vulnerability Assessments and Penetration Testing.

The goal of this project was to allow a portable set of tools to be installed onto an Ubuntu 20 system.

Contents of the project
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
static.sh - Downloads static applications which are not svn capable
svn.sh - SVN repository scripts to checkout and update the various tools
update-tools.sh - update script for all the tools that have git/svn functionality or that I created an update script for.
install.sh - The script that makes it all happen
readme - You're looking at it

All tools are loaded into the /vapt directory.

How To
------
To start, run the installer: sudo ./install.sh
Install the dependencies first via option 1) Install/Check Dependencies
Once the deps scripts has completed, walk through the remaining install options. Install the svn/git and static tools and finally the wordlists.
